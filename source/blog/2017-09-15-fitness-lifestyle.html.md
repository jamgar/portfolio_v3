It goes without saying, but beginning a workout regiment can be difficult. Every year we many people make a "New Years Resolution" to begin working out or to get fit, with great intentions, but for one reason or another they do not fulfill the resolution. Life happens or the goals that they set were unrealistic and when they do not see the results, as hoped for, they become disappointed and give up. I want to share a few key points that help me with staying on track with my workout regiment and form a habit (aka, make it a lifestyle).

###Start Small
People see that I workout on a regular basis, and will ask me, 'Where do I start?'. I assume that whoever ask me this question 1) has never worked out, or 2) has not worked out in a long time. My response is to *start small*. You may have heard of the phrase "you have to crawl before you can walk" and that idea applies here as well. People will try to tell/sell you that you have to go to the gym and do this elaborate workout, but that is not what you need when you first start out. What I mean by starting small is to begin with something easy like going for a 20 to 30 minute walk 3 to 5 times a week. Try to keep these walks at a brisk pace, if you can. After a couple of weeks you could even add in doing push ups and/or squats at a set interval during your walk. For instance, after ever 2 minutes of walking you can stop and do a few squats and a few push ups and then walk again for 2 more minutes and repeat the cycle. Then after a couple of months of this you could begin exploring gyms. Many of them will give you free trial period before you commit to a membership. If they don't then they are probably not worth joining. Your other option could be making your home gym.

###Make A Schedule
Write out your schedule either on a wall calender, or enter it into your email calendar. Something that you can see everyday to remind yourself that you have a scheduled workout session. Yes, even if you are just doing a walk. This is especially helpful if you have a busy schedule or your work/family schedule changes from day to day. This is all geared at forming a habit. As a side note, do not beat yourself up if you have to miss a workout, and do not try to make it up. Just continue to do your next workout on it's schedule day.

###Find What You Like
This is a two part topic. The first, find a fitness activity that you enjoy doing. You may not know automatically what you like so try different activities. You may be able to find different free activities on meetup.com, if you live in or near a major city. It is also a great way to meet like minded people.

The second part is do your activity, if possible, at a time that best suits you. For instance, I know many people that would rather workout early in the morning than in the evening. Some even do it during their lunch break. Try different times and see what works for you.

###Find A Partner
If possible, find someone that is willing and wanting to get fit with you. It makes doing the workout so much easier, especially when you first start out, if you have someone to hold you accountable. It is a good idea to be open about your goals because you two want to be on the same page. Also find someone that is encouraging, and will motivate you when you are just not 'feeling it'.

###Change It Up
This goes back to trying different activities to find what you like to do. It is also good to keep your workouts interesting. Different activities work different muscle so this may help you get over a hump mentally and/or physically.

Fitness should be a lifestyle, and not some short term "New Years Resolution". These tips can help you to make that change, and with a little planning and determination you will be living a fit life. Remember to start small, and most of all have fun.
