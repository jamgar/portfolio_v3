OrgBoard is an app built with React for the the frontend and Rail 5 API for the backend. This was a bootcamp project that I used for my React, React Router project. A user can signup and then create boards to organize their notes.

This was a great project to challenge myself. The Rails API I built a simple authentication system. I used JSON Web Token to pass a token to store on the frontend for authorization. I used ActiveModel Serializer to manage the JSON response.

For the frontend, as I said above, I used React, and React Router. I also used Redux for state managment, Redux Form for the forms management, and Bootstrap for styling.

The frontend is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and the backend on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Feel free to sign up and try it out. It is not mind blowing, but it gave me some great experience with both technologies working together.

Peace, Love, and Happy coding!
